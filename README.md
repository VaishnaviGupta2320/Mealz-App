Developed a dynamic and visually engaging food discovery application named Mealz App, which allows users to explore various food categories, view detailed meal descriptions, and enjoy a smooth and interactive user experience.
Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns and maintainable code.
Networking: Integrated Retrofit for efficient API calls to fetch meal data from the MealDB API.
Asynchronous Programming: Utilized Kotlin Coroutines for managing background threads and handling asynchronous tasks smoothly.
Data Handling: Employed a Repository pattern to abstract data sources and simplify data access.
ViewModel: Used Android Jetpack ViewModel to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
Implemented custom animations including:
Expandable list items for meal details.
Smooth size transitions for interactive content.
Collapsing Toolbar for enhanced visual hierarchy and a modern app feel.
Ensured responsive design for various screen sizes and orientations.
